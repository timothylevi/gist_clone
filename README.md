## Custom Text Search Select

[View source](https://github.com/timothylevi/gist_clone/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/views/text_search_select.js) to see how custom text search select was created in JS and jQuery. Creates field where text options can be searched through (based on sub-string starting at the beginning of a word), and allows user to select (or deselect) multiple options which are then highlighted (or un-highlighted)!
